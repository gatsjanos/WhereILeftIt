# Where I Left It?
Have you ever been in a situation when you **left your phone** in a community room or **at your friend's house** and you had to think search for half an our for it? Or Worse: Have you ever **lost your phone during hiking**?

Only if you would know **where and when** was the last time **you had your phone**...

This open source app lets you know it!
<br><br><br>
`Where I Left It`  **logs** your phone's **time, geolocation and orientation** continuously to an RFID card (or film) what you fixed in your pocket.

Lost your phone? Just **read the card** and you will know, where and when was **the last time, your phone was in your pocket**!

You can do the reading with an other phone or a regular NFC reader.
<br><br><br>
No need for internet.

In case of loosing GPS signal, you will see the last time and location when GPS was working and you will also see the time and orientation, when your phone was in your pocket for the last time.
